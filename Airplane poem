    <h2>Poem</h2>
    
    <p>I've made a paper airplane <br>
With wings of Crayola blue <br>
I made it just for me <br>
To fly away with you. <br></p>

    <p>To fly away from this old world <br>
With all its storms of tears <br>
I made it out of cardstock <br>
So it should last for years. <br></p> 

    <p>Goodbye, all you people <br>
Who fill the world with hate. <br> 
I'm flying off to happier lands <br> 
Before it gets too late <br></p> 

    <p>'Cause then I'll be a goner <br>
Drowning in your lies <br>
So now I think I'll fly away <br>
And explore the foreign skies. <br></p>
